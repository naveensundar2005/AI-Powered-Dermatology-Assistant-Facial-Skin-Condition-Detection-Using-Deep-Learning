# 🧑‍⚕️ AI-Powered Dermatology Assistant  
### 🔬 Deep Learning-Based Skin Disease Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This **AI-powered dermatology assistant** is a deep learning-based system designed to **detect and classify skin diseases** from images.  
Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model analyzes skin conditions and provides **confidence scores** for potential diagnoses.

## 🔬 How It Works (Deep Learning Workflow)  
1️⃣ **Dataset Preparation:**  
   - Dermatology image dataset is **preprocessed** (resized, augmented, normalized).  
   - Labels are assigned based on different skin diseases.  

2️⃣ **Model Training (CNN Architecture):**  
   - A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
   - The model learns to recognize patterns in skin disease images.  

3️⃣ **Image Analysis & Prediction:**  
   - Users **upload an image** through a web UI.  
   - The AI model **analyzes the image** and predicts the **skin disease type**.  
   - The system returns a **confidence score** (how certain the model is about the prediction).  

4️⃣ **Deployment & User Interaction:**  
   - The trained model is **deployed using Flask**.  
   - Users can interact with the assistant via a **web application**.
